Billy
=====

Billy is a simple app for quickly writing down what you spend (or earn).It's not a full-fledged accounting software and doesn't offer reporting or categorizing functionality for example. Instead it's meant to be like a little notebook that helps you store where your money went for a small period of time in a very quick & dirty way. Until you finally have a spare minute when you could scroll through all this mess and format it properly in whichever place you're tracking your money.I'm not a fan of carrying all my financial records on the phone, so I wrote this app as an improvement over just keeping text notes on the phone.

History
-----

It was up on the AppStore as a free app for one year and got about 2000 downloads and only 4-5 star ratings. But I chose not to extend my iOS developer account therefore I'm now open sourcing it. It was written back in 2010 to work on iOS 3.0 so it has manual reference management and in general might be a little out of date.
